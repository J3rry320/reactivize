# Reactivize

  

![REACTIVIZE](https://iili.io/HehSO4s.png)

***Reactivize is a modern and flexible alternative to Create React App that allows you to generate a fully configured React project with just a single command***. It's the result of my personal experience and preference for creating React projects using Webpack. I found that this approach offered a more streamlined and efficient development experience compared to Create React App, and I wanted to share this powerful tool with the community.

## Why Reactivize? 🤔

  

Reactivize offers several advantages over Create React App, making it an attractive option for developers looking to start a new project:

  

- **Modern Directory Structure**: Reactivize follows best practises for organising project files, making it easier to navigate and maintain your codebase.

- **Webpack for Production**: Reactivize uses Webpack to minify and bundle your project for production, ensuring optimal performance and smaller bundle sizes.

- **Font Awesome Support**: Reactivize comes with built-in support for Font Awesome, a popular icon library, making it easy to add icons and improve the visual appeal of your project.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Reactivize allows you to customise your project setup, including optional support for TypeScript, Redux, and React Router. This makes it easy to tailor the project to your specific needs and preferences.

  

## Installation

Reactivize can be installed globally using npm:

  

```bash

npm install  -g  reactivize

```

## Usage

  

To create a new React project with Reactivize, run the following command:

  

```bash

reactivize my-project -nt 
#or
npx reactivize my-project -nt 

cd  my-project

npm start

```

 

This will create a new directory called `my-project` with a directory structure that I've used over the years while working with various types of projects. The structure is organised in a way that allows you to easily manage your code and keep everything organised. .

 You can always get help by running 
 ```bash
 reactivize -h 
```

In addition, I used ChatGPT's help to make my logger message funny by adding a twist that might surprise the user. So, you can expect a little bit of humour while using Reactivize.

  

## Features

  

- **Webpack**: Reactivize uses Webpack to bundle your files, providing greater flexibility and customization options than the built-in react-scripts used by create-react-app.

- **Directory Structure**: The directory structure generated by Reactivize is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it easier to organise your code.

- **Router and Reducer**: Reactivize comes with built-in support for routers and reducers, making it easier to manage complex projects.

- **Customizable**: With Reactivize, you can easily customise your Webpack configuration to suit your project's specific needs.

- **Future TypeScript Support**: Reactivize is actively developing support for TypeScript, making it an ideal choice for projects using TypeScript.

  

## Getting Started

  

Once you've created a new project using Reactivize, you can start editing your files in the "src" directory. You can start the development server using "npm start." The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080/`.

  

In addition, Reactivize comes with pre-configured scripts that make it easy to build and deploy your project. You can use `npm run build` to create a production-ready build of your project, and `npm run deploy` to deploy your project to a hosting provider like Netlify or Heroku.
